# Small Concrete Stuff [BAD]
- Colorblind mode would be good
- Add DAS
- Sprites
- Reset command
- Commands explanation

# Bigger Picture Stuff [BAD]
- Unlocking Controls
- Not great that you can solve without leaving the white face
- Plugging in the solution once it's been retrieved from a solver is somewhat underwhelming
- Providing a goal...?

# Bigger Picture Stuff [GOOD]
- Having to use buttons to leave the starting location
- The maze is simple
- Color pallete / simplicity
- Figuring out that it's a Rubik's Cube
- Exploration to figure things out
