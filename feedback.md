## Bigger Picture Stuff [BAD]

- Maybe unlock controls over time?
- Not great that you can solve without leaving the white face
- Plugging in the solution once it's been retrieved from a solver is somewhat underwhelming
- Provide a goal...?

## Bigger Picture Stuff [GOOD]

- Having to use buttons to leave the starting location
- The maze is simple
- Color pallete / simplicity
